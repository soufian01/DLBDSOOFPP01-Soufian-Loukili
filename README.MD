# General Info
This is a backend application for tracking and monitoring user habits created specifically for the course Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming with Python (DLBDSOOFPP01). In this software I created a main habit class with two attributes (habit name and habit period) and five methods to interact with the various habits. The methods are create(1), check(2), analyze(3), test(4), delete(5). These methods allow interaction with the program and its database in order to add, mark, analyze, test, and delete habits.

## Installation 
If you are using Mac or Linux you can run the software directly because python is preinstalled on these operating systems if you are using Windows you will have to install Python first. To do this you can directly use the link on the official Python website: "https://www.python.org/downloads/". Once you have made sure you have installed Python correctly proceed to install sqlite3 from the command line to do so you can use the command "pip install sqlite3" and pressing return.

### Usage
Once you have finished installing Python and sqlite3 you can launch the software by typing "py habit.py" or "python habit.py," from there on the possible options will appear and it will be possible for the user to interact with their habits. The user will be able to choose which function they want to use using the command line. You can create, check, analyze, test and delete habits. The software comes with some habits already entered and saved to database, such as daily habit for reading.
